description: As a developer in the <a href="http://dali.dartmouth.edu/">DALI lab</a> over the summer of 2015, I worked with a team to redesign the entire Dartmouth newspaper website and create a custom Wordpress theme for the site. The project is budgeted to be completed within the next term, and as a result the site is not live. The mockup of a sample category page I developed is posted above!
