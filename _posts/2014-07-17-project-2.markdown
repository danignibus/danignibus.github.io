description: I'm currently working with a group of Dartmouth students to develop an iOS/Android application that will ease coordination of Dartmouth activities ranging from meals to pong to hikes to workouts.

Take a look at my <a href="https://gist.github.com/danignibus/2d57237bbe2966f17193">gist</a> for my Needone backend Django work!
